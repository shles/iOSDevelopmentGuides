##### Convert to .pem

## Theory

### GCD vs NSOperation

 - __GCD__ is a lightweight way to represent units of work that are going to be executed concurrently. You donâ€™t schedule these units of work; the system takes care of scheduling for you. Adding dependency among blocks can be a headache. Canceling or suspending a block creates extra work for you as a developer!

 - __Operation__  adds a little extra overhead compared to GCD, but you can add dependency among various operations and re-use, cancel or suspend them.
 
##### Stop block execution using GCD
###### Objective-C (iOS 8.0+)
```Objective-C
dispatch_block_t work = dispatch_block_create(0, ^{
  NSLog(@"Hello.");
});
dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(10 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), work);

dispatch_block_cancel(work)
```
